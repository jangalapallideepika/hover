            <h2>ADIYOGI</h2>
            <p>The Statue of Belief or Vishwas Swaroopam is a statue of the Hindu God Shiva constructed at Nathdwara. Currently, the Statue of Belief is the tallest statue of Lord Shiva in the World.
            Adiyogi means the first yogi. In the yogic culture, Shiva is not known as a God, but as the Adiyogi or the first yogi â€“ the originator of yoga. He was the one who first put this seed into the human mind.
